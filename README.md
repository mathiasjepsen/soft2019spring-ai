# Introduction

The Machine Learning & AI course is one of two elective courses on the 1./2.
semester of the Bachelor programme at Cphbusiness/Lyngby SOFT. It is taught
this semester (2019, spring) by Jens Egholm Pedersen (JEEP) and Jacob Trier
Frederiksen (JTF).

* General information on the courses of spring 2019 semester is on GitHub here:
  * https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2019spring/

* Specific information on ML & AI course is on GitHub here:
  * https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2019spring/AI_plan.html

* Course books: 
  * 100 page ML book: http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php
  * Hands-on ML with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2

* Course work material is on GitHub, here:
  * https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-ai

We shall use the following resource infrastructure:

## Moodle
  * We will use the courses' [Moodle Flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=3151) for announcements to the class.

## GitHub
  * Will be used extensively for relaying [course materials](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-ai), so link it in.

## Peergrade
  * All hand-in assignments are subject to peer review (you "grade" your fellow students), and will be conducted through [Peergrade](https://www.peergrade.io/join). You will receive information from us on how to sign up and participate in due time. 

## Mentimeter
  * For active participation during class hours, we shall use the peer participation tool [Mentimeter:]( https://www.menti.com). You will receive instructions from us in due time, during the course when active participation is warranted (or required).

## Additional resources
There exists a ton of resources that helps you understand the material. 
Be proactive: find the video/books/games/friends that helps you learn!
